## Product Definition

The aim of this app is to revolutionize the world of sneaker raffles by creating equal opportunities for its user base. We will accomplish this through various security and verification practices set up to prevent the usage of bots in our raffles. The success of this app could lead all the way up to integration with major brands within the industry. Ultimately we want to bring the power back to the user, from the hardcore sneaker enthusiasts all the way to the casual student who just wants a chance at the hot new pair on the market.

## Vision

The purpose of our program is to make a fairer sneaker raffle system. In the past people would have to camp out in order to get a limited release of a pair of sneakers they wanted. Over time apps took over which made the transactions safer and quicker. However, the development of automated software called "bots" has made it so a select few with this software are able to snag and to purchase the product and in turn resell them for profit. This has ruined the love and passion for many collectors over time. Our overarching vision encompasses the widespread adoption or integration of our program by major brand entities within the industry. This strategic alignment would effectively level the playing field, ensuring that every individual is afforded an opportunity to purchase their desired pair of sneakers.

## User Stories

### Feature 1: Raffle System

**Description**

- The raffle system is the main feature of our app, and will provide an equal opportunity to every user who enters the raffle. 
This will allow anyone who has a user account to enter the raffle for a chance to acquire limited edition shoes that are highly sought after. 
Only after the time has finished will the raffle be available to enter, for a set amount of time depending on the raffle.

**User Story 1**

- A collector of limited edition shoes becomes aware of a new release of a highly desired pair of sneakers on the market.
Unfortunately, everywhere they look the shoes are sold out; until they find out that our app has 10 in stock, only available through our raffle system. 
While this is not a guarantee, the collector decides to try his luck in our fair raffle, and is reminded just as the raffle is about to begin.
He receives the shoes he wanted fairly, as he was chosen as one of the 10 to gain the ability to purchase.

**Constraints**

- While we strive to make the app as fair as possible, it is extremely difficult to get rid of bots altogether. 

**Comments**

- Users can only enter a raffle one time; establishing a proper defense against any work-arounds to this rule is essential to maintain a fair experience.
